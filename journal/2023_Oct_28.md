## A Beautiful Turn 美好的转身
### A lesson from a woman's faith
(Matthew 9:20-22, Mark 5:26-34)
A woman flowing blood for 12 years headed by touching Jesus' garment

The woman had faith before approaching Jesus (Hebrew 11:6), even with the obstacles she had for example, she had lost everything she had, she was trembling when Jesus calling her out. 

### A lesson from James and John hearts 
(Luke 9:51-56)
James and John were not aware that the manner of their hearts (verse 55):
- murderous
- arrogant
- against the will of God
- overdo Jesus' instructions (verse 5) by adding more burdens like Pharisee 
- ignorance, misuse the teaching applications
