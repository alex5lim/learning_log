## Fullness of Joy
How to live a life with the fullness of joy? 
In Ecclesiastes 2 we learned from the Preacher about the vanity of pleasures. 
The material world cannot bring true joy in life. 
What then can bring true happiness?

The true path to joy has been shown by our Lord Jesus Christ.
Hebrew 12:1-2: 
"Therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, 
let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, 
and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus, 
the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, 
despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God."
This reminds me of La Madonna della Pieta. 


Conclusion is given in Psalm 16:11:
"You will show me the path of life;
In Your presence is fullness of joy;
At Your right hand are pleasures forevermore."

Pr Kong sermon as an above is similar with JBP's rule that says:
"Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient)."
