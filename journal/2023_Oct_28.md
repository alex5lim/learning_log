## A Beautiful Turn 美好的转身
by Pr. Chin Aun Quek
### A lesson from a woman's faith
(Matthew 9:20-22, Mark 5:26-34)
A woman flowing blood for 12 years headed by touching Jesus' garment

The woman had faith before approaching Jesus (Hebrew 11:6), even with the obstacles she had for example, she had lost everything she had, she was trembling when Jesus calling her out. 

### A lesson from the disciples' hearts 
(Luke 9:51-56)
James and John were not aware that the manner of their hearts (verse 55):
- murderous
- arrogant
- against the will of God
- overdo Jesus' instructions (verse 5) by adding more burdens like Pharisee 
- ignorance, misuse the teaching applications

In conclusion, we need to truly understand the scriptures so we understand the will of God and will not misinterpret the scriptures. 

Surely, James and John repented after the incident. 

## Returning Home (2)
by Dn. Enoch

### Encouragement to come back home
Church is our home (Ephesians 2:19). Do not forsake the assembly (Hebrew 10:25). 

### The Prodigal Son
(Luke 15:11-32)
Reflections:
- Are we wandering outside in the cruel world? Do we miss home? Or we forgot about home?
- Do we feel hurt by our brother/sister? 

### The Lost Sheep
(Matthew 18:12-14)
We are precious member of the family. Church service is a family gathering. 
Reflections:
- Is God really at the centre of our worship?
- Are we at peace with the brothers and sisters? (1 John 4:7-8, 20)
