## Fullness of Joy
Ecclesiastes 2: the vanity of pleasures. 
The material world cannot bring true joy in life. 
What then can bring true happiness?

Pr Kong sermon is similar with JBP's rule that says 
"Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient)." It reminds me of La Madonna della Pieta. 
The true path to joy has been shown by our Lord Jesus Christ Hebrew 12:1-2. 
Conclusion: Psalm 16:11, "You will show me the path of life;
In Your presence is fullness of joy;
At Your right hand are pleasures forevermore."
